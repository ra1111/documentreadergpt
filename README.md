**Title: Building a Document Retrieval System with Langchain and OpenAI**

**Introduction:**
In the world of natural language processing and information retrieval, building efficient systems for retrieving relevant documents based on user queries is of utmost importance. In this article, we will explore how to create a document retrieval system using the Langchain library and OpenAI's language models.

**Setting Up the Environment:**
To get started, we need to import the necessary libraries. We'll import the `ABC` class and the `abstractmethod` decorator from the `abc` module, as well as the `List` type from the `typing` module. Additionally, we'll import the `Document` class from the `langchain.schema` module. Here's the initial code snippet:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import List
from langchain.schema import Document
```

**Defining the BaseRetriever Abstract Class:**
Next, we'll define an abstract class called `BaseRetriever`, which will serve as the foundation for our document retrieval system. This class will have one abstract method, `get_relevant_documents`, which takes a query string as input and returns a list of relevant documents. Here's the code snippet:

```python
class BaseRetriever(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_relevant_documents(self, query: str) -> List[Document]:
        """Get texts relevant for a query.

        Args:
            query: string to find relevant texts for

        Returns:
            List of relevant documents
        """
```

**Setting Up OpenAI and Langchain:**
To integrate OpenAI's language models and Langchain into our document retrieval system, we need to import the required modules and initialize the necessary components. We import `openai` for OpenAI API access, and `os` for environment variables. We also set the OpenAI API key by assigning it to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. Here's the code snippet:

```python
import openai
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""
```

Additionally, we import the required Langchain modules: `RetrievalQA` from `langchain.chains`, `OpenAI` from `langchain.llms`, `TextLoader` from `langchain.document_loaders`, and `VectorstoreIndexCreator` from `langchain.indexes`. Here's the code snippet:

```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator
```

**Loading and Indexing Documents:**
To perform document retrieval, we need to load the documents into our system and create an index for efficient querying. We use the `TextLoader` class from Langchain to load a text document (e.g., "state_of_the_union.txt"). We pass the text file name and encoding as arguments. Here's the code snippet:

```python
loader = TextLoader('state_of_the_union.txt', encoding='utf8')
```

We then create an index using the `VectorstoreIndexCreator` class from Langchain. We call the `from_loaders` method on the index creator and pass our document loader as an argument. Here's the code snippet:

```python
index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader])
```

**User Query and Conversation Display:**
To interact with our document retrieval system, we provide a user interface for querying and displaying conversations. We use the `panel` library to create an interactive dashboard. Here's the code snippet for setting up the user interface:

```python
import panel as pn
pn.extension()

panels = [] # collect display 

inp = pn.widgets.TextInput(value="Hi", placeholder='Enter text hereâ€¦')
button_conversation = pn.widgets.Button(name="Ask your Query!")

interactive_conversation = pn.bind(collect_messages, button_conversation)

dashboard = pn.Column(
    inp,
    pn.Row(button_conversation),
    pn.panel(interactive_conversation, loading_indicator=True, height=300),
)
```

**Handling User Queries and Displaying Results:**
To handle user queries and display the results, we define a function called `collect_messages`. This function takes the user's query as input, performs the document retrieval using the index, and displays the query and response in the dashboard. Here's the code snippet for the `collect_messages` function:

```python
def collect_messages(_):
    prompt = inp.value_input
    # ... (omitted code for brevity)
    if(prompt!=""):
        response=index.query(prompt)
    panels.append(
        pn.Row('User:', pn.pane.Markdown(prompt, width=600)))
    panels.append(
        pn.Row('Assistant:', pn.pane.Markdown(response, width=600, style={'background-color': '#F6F6F6'})))
 
    return pn.Column(*panels)
```

**Conclusion:**
In this article, we explored how to build a document retrieval system using Langchain and OpenAI's language models. We covered the basics of setting up the environment, defining an abstract class for the retriever, loading and indexing documents, and creating a user interface for querying and displaying conversations. By combining these technologies, you can create powerful and efficient systems for retrieving relevant documents based on user queries.

Remember to install the required libraries, set up your OpenAI API key, and adapt the code snippets to your specific use case. Happy document retrieval!
